Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?
ANS. The three measures of central tendency are:

Mean: The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency and is appropriate for normally distributed data.

Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. It is not affected by extreme values and is appropriate for skewed data.

Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It is appropriate for categorical data or data with a discrete set of va


Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the
central tendency of a dataset?
ANS. The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency that are used to describe the center or typical value of a dataset. However, they differ in how they are calculated and how they reflect the distribution of the data.

The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency because it takes into account all the values in the dataset. However, it can be affected by extreme values, or outliers, that are very different from the other values in the dataset.

The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. It is not affected by extreme values and is a useful measure of central tendency for skewed datasets. For example, if a dataset has a few very high values, the mean may be larger than what is typical, but the median will not be affected.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is useful for identifying the most common value or category in a dataset, especially for categorical or nominal data.



Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:
[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
ANS. To calculate the measures of central tendency for the given height data, we need to find the mean, median, and mode:

Mean:
To find the mean, we add up all the values and divide by the total number of values:

178 + 177 + 176 + 177 + 178.2 + 178 + 175 + 179 + 180 + 175 + 178.9 + 176.2 + 177 + 172.5 + 178 + 176.5 = 2808.3

There are 16 values in the dataset, so the mean is:

2808.3 / 16 = 175.52

Median:
To find the median, we need to order the values from smallest to largest and find the middle value:

172.5, 175, 175, 176, 176.2, 176.5, 177, 177, 178, 178, 178, 178.2, 178.9, 179, 180

There are 16 values in the dataset, so the median is the average of the 8th and 9th values:

(177 + 178) / 2 = 177.5

Mode:
The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. In this case, there are two values that occur most frequently: 177 and 178. We could report both values as the mode, or we could say that there is no single mode for this dataset.

Therefore, the measures of central tendency for the given height data are:

Mean: 175.52
Median: 177.5
Mode: No single mode or bimodal distribution



Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:
 [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
 
ANS. To find the standard deviation for the given data, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the mean of the data
We have already calculated the mean in the previous question, which is 175.52.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between each value and the mean
We can calculate the difference between each value and the mean using the formula:

difference = value - mean

For example, for the first value (178), the difference is:

difference = 178 - 175.52 = 2.48

We can do this for all the values and get the following differences:

2.48, 1.48, 0.48, 1.48, 2.68, 2.48, -0.52, 3.48, 4.48, -0.52, 3.38, 0.68, 1.48, -3.02, 2.48, 1.98

Step 3: Square each difference
We need to square each difference to get rid of the negative signs and emphasize the differences that are further from the mean. We get the following squares:

6.1504, 2.1904, 0.2304, 2.1904, 7.1824, 6.1504, 0.2704, 12.0704, 20.0704, 0.2704, 11.4244, 0.4624, 2.1904, 9.1204, 6.1504, 3.9204

Step 4: Sum the squares of the differences
We can add up all the squares of the differences to get the sum of squares:

sum of squares = 83.1328

Step 5: Divide by the sample size minus one
We need to divide the sum of squares by the sample size minus one (n-1), where n is the number of values in the dataset. In this case, we have 16 values, so n-1=15. We get:

variance = sum of squares / (n-1) = 83.1328 / 15 = 5.54219

Step 6: Take the square root of the variance
Finally, we take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation:

standard deviation = sqrt(variance) = sqrt(5.54219) = 2.354

Therefore, the standard deviation for the given data is approximately 2.354.



Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe
the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.
ANS. Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset.

Range is the difference between the largest and smallest value in a dataset and provides a simple measure of the spread of the data. For example, if the range of a dataset is 20, it means that the difference between the largest and smallest value is 20.

Variance is a measure of how far the values in a dataset are from the mean. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean, and then dividing by the total number of values in the dataset minus one. A higher variance indicates greater variability in the data.

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average distance of values from the mean. It is useful because it is expressed in the same units as the original data. A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data.

For example, let's consider the test scores of a class of 10 students: 65, 72, 74, 80, 81, 82, 85, 90, 95, 98.

The range of the scores is 98 - 65 = 33.

The variance can be calculated as follows:

Calculate the mean: (65 + 72 + 74 + 80 + 81 + 82 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 98) / 10 = 82
Calculate the difference between each value and the mean: (-17, -10, -8, -2, -1, 0, 3, 8, 13, 16)
Square each difference: (289, 100, 64, 4, 1, 0, 9, 64, 169, 256)
Calculate the sum of squared differences: 956
Divide by the total number of values minus one: 956 / 9 = 106.22
The standard deviation can be calculated by taking the square root of the variance: sqrt(106.22) = 10.31



Q6. What is a Venn diagram?
ANS. A Venn diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between different sets or groups of data. It consists of overlapping circles or other shapes, with each circle representing a set or group, and the overlap representing the elements that are common to both sets. The areas of the circles or shapes can also be proportional to the size of the sets they represent.

Venn diagrams are often used to illustrate logical relationships between sets, such as the intersection or union of sets, and can be used in a variety of fields including mathematics, statistics, and computer science. They can also be used to compare and contrast different groups or categories of data in a way that is easy to understand and visually appealing.


Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10). Find:
(i) A B
(ii) A ⋃ B

ANS. (i) A B represents the intersection of sets A and B, which is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case,
the only element that is in both sets is 2, so A B = {2}.

(ii) A ⋃ B represents the union of sets A and B, which is the set of all elements that are in either set A or set B, or both. In this case, 
the elements in A ⋃ B are {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}

Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?
ANS. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution of data. A distribution is said to be skewed if the data is not symmetrically distributed around the mean. In a skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution (the part that extends away from the peak) is longer on one side than the other.

There are two types of skewness: positive skewness and negative skewness. Positive skewness occurs when the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side, meaning that the majority of the data is concentrated on the left side of the distribution. Negative skewness occurs when the tail of the distribution is longer on the left side, meaning that the majority of the data is concentrated on the right side of the distribution.


Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?
ANS. If a data is right-skewed, the median will be less than the mean. This is because in a right-skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution
is longer on the right side, which means there are more extreme values on the right side of the distribution. As a result, the mean is pulled to
the right of the peak of the distribution, towards the higher values. On the other hand, the median is not affected by extreme values in the same way,
and it is more resistant to outliers. Therefore, it tends to be closer to the center of the distribution, where there is more density of data. In 
a right-skewed distribution, the median will typically be closer to the lower values, while the mean will be closer to the higher values.



Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in
statistical analysis?
ANS. Covariance and correlation are two measures of the relationship between two variables.

Covariance measures how two variables vary together. It is a measure of the degree to which two variables change in tandem. If the covariance between two variables is positive, it means that they tend to move in the same direction. If the covariance is negative, it means that they tend to move in opposite directions. However, covariance alone does not indicate the strength or direction of the relationship between the two variables.

Correlation, on the other hand, measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It is a standardized version of covariance that ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship, a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, and a correlation of 0 indicates no relationship at all.



Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a
dataset.
ANS. The formula for calculating the sample mean is:

x̄ = Σx / n

Where x̄ is the sample mean, Σx is the sum of all the values in the sample, and n is the number of values in the sample.

Here's an example calculation of the sample mean for a dataset:

Suppose we have the following dataset of 6 values:

5, 8, 12, 6, 10, 4

To calculate the sample mean, we first add up all the values in the dataset:

5 + 8 + 12 + 6 + 10 + 4 = 45

Then we divide the sum by the number of values in the dataset:

45 / 6 = 7.5

Therefore, the sample mean for this dataset is 7.5.


Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?
ANS. For a normal distribution data, the mean, median, and mode are all equal, and they are located at the center of the distribution. This means that the measure of central tendency is the same for all three measures.

In a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the central tendency, with the same number of values on either side of the central point. This is why the mean, median, and mode are all located at the center of the distribution. The relationship between these measures of central tendency is that they all provide an estimate of the typical value of the data.

The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. The median is the middle value in the dataset when the values are arranged in order. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset.

Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?
ANS. Covariance and correlation are two measures that describe the relationship between two variables in a dataset. The main difference between covariance and correlation is that covariance measures the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables, whereas correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables after normalizing for the scale of the variables.

Correlation, on the other hand, is a normalized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation ranges from -1 to 1, with -1 indicating a perfectly negative linear relationship, 0 indicating no linear relationship, and 1 indicating a perfectly positive linear relationship. Correlation is preferred over covariance when comparing the relationship between two variables, as correlation normalizes the data and makes it easier to interpret.

Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.
Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from other values in a dataset. Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion.

Outliers can affect measures of central tendency, such as the mean and median, by pulling the values of the central tendency towards them. For example, if a dataset contains values of 10, 20, 30, and 1000, the mean will be greatly affected by the outlier value of 1000. The mean will be 265, while the median, which is the middle value when the values are ordered, will be 25. Outliers can also affect the mode, which is the most common value in the dataset, by shifting it to an outlier value.

Outliers can also affect measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation. For example, if a dataset contains values of 10, 20, 30, and 1000, the range will be greatly affected by the outlier value of 1000. The range will be 990, while the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles, will be 20. The variance and standard deviation will also be affected by outliers, with a larger variance and standard deviation indicating more variability in the data.
